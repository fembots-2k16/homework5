        -if apricltags doesn't work outside of ros it won't work inside ros

    1. camera...
        kinects on two platforms (ubuntu)
        -kinects can be run off of robot batteries (the ones that are hooked up)
        
        -if you have linux running natively, you can use your laptop camera easily (can mount your laptop on the robot...)
        
        -if you have a raspi cam that would work too...
        
        
    2. tell computer what the size of the AR tag is, and it can calculate the distance/3d distance from the camera
        -when it sees the tag, it gives you an offset
    
    
    3. only work in the lab (tags on the outside walls and as tags on obstacles in the middle)
    
    4. can do *MOST* of this in ros
        -use a controller to look for the tags, to "servo into them"???
